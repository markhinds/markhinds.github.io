I'm enrolled at Georgia Institute of Technology to pursue a Masters in Computer Science with a specialization in Machine Learning in August 2023. Before enrolling, I was a post baccalaureate Intern at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) in the Information Systems and Modeling Group (A-1) During the summer of 2022, and the majority of 2023. I had worked under Nathanial Blanchard in the HCAI research group at Colorado State University (2021â€“2022). I completed my B.S in Statistics at Colorado State University in 2022. I'm currently work for the Statistical Science group (CCS-6) at LANL under Natalie Klein.

CCS-6: 

May 2022-August 2023: Post-Baccalaureate Intern (Los Alamos National Lab)
(A-1: Information Systems and Modeling)
National Critical Decomposition
  * Created decompositions for national critical functions using internal software by researching key subfunctions to systems.
  * Researched risk and sensitivity quantification methods to understand propagation in interdependent systems.
Electrical Power Restoration Modeling
  * Developed python scripts to collect geospatial earthquake data.
  * Created visualizations, plots and tables summarizing key statistics in R.
  * Conducted a literature review for current state of the art power restoration models during extreme storm events.
  * Supporting the development of a national scale model to predict the outage assessment and repair times following an extreme storm event.
Outage Prediction Modeling (A-1: Information Systems and Modeling)
  * Developed a data pipeline to build a dataset that improves the spatial and temporal resolution of the current in- production outage prediction model using Python and R.
  * Identified key parameters used in published and in production models.
  * Collaborated with a team of researchers to design an efficient outage prediction model.
  * Analyzed the dataset to produce visualizations and insightful metrics based off exploratory data analysis.
