I am currently pursuing a M.S. in Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology (Aug. 2023 - Dec. 2025). Prior to my enrollment, I interned at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) within the Information Systems and Modeling Group during the summer of 2022 and was later converted to a post-baccalaureate intern in 2023. 

During my undergrad, I worked under Dr. [Nathaniel Blanchard](https://sites.google.com/view/nathanieltblanchard) in the [Computer Vision lab at Colorado State University](https://csu-computer-vision-lab.squarespace.com/) from 2021 to 2022. I earned my B.S. in Statistics from Colorado State University in 2022. 

Presently, I am employed by the Statistical Science group as a Graduate Research Assistant at LANL working under [Natalie Klein](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VlHLqU0AAAAJ&hl=en) applying probabilitistic, XAI, and data fusion machine learning methods in planetary science. 

My other research interests include bayesian methods, casual inference, and quantitative finance. 

# Education
* M.S. in Computer Science, Georgia Institute of Technology, Exp. 2025
* B.S. in Statistics, Colorado State University, 2022
* A.A. in Business Administration, Red Rocks Community College, 2019

# Work experience
### January 2024 - Present: Graduate Research Assistant (Los Alamos National Lab)
(Statistical Sciences)

*Geochemical Composition Prediction with Spectral Data* 

  * Implemented data fusion models to handle multi-modal spectral data to improve composition prediction. 
  * Implemented Deep Neural networks with PyTorch to predict elemental composition for spectral data improving model performance by 10% compared to industry standard approaches.
  * Produced uncertainty quantification results to collaborators via and presented research in the Machine Learning for Physical Sciences (ML4PS) workshop at NeurIPS 2024.
  * Applied model explainability techniques to reveal how machine learning models arrive at predictions, helping non-technical collaborators to understand which features drive predictions and fostering trust in deep learning technologies.


## May 2022 - August 2023: Post-Baccalaureate Intern (Los Alamos National Lab)
(Information Systems and Modeling)

*Electrical Power Restoration Modeling*
  * Developed python scripts to collect geospatial earthquake data.
  * Created visualizations, plots and tables summarizing key statistics in R.
  * Conducted a literature review for current state of the art power restoration models during extreme storm events.
  * Supporting the development of a national scale model to predict the outage assessment and repair times following an extreme storm event.

*Outage Prediction Modeling*
  * Developed a data pipeline to build a dataset that improves the spatial and temporal resolution of the current in- production outage prediction model using Python and R.
  * Identified key parameters used in published and in production models.
  * Collaborated with a team of researchers to design an efficient outage prediction model.
  * Analyzed the dataset to produce visualizations and insightful metrics based off exploratory data analysis.
