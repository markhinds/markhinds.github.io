I am currently pursuing a M.S. in Computer Science with a specialization in Machine Learning at the Georgia Institute of Technology (Aug 2023 - May 2025). Prior to my enrollment, I interned at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) within the Information Systems and Modeling Group (A-1) during the summer of 2022 and was later converted to a post baccalaureate intern in 2023. During my undergrad, I worked under Dr. [Nathaniel Blanchard](https://sites.google.com/view/nathanieltblanchard) in the [Computer Vision lab at Colorado State University](https://csu-computer-vision-lab.squarespace.com/) from 2021 to 2022. I earned my B.S. in Statistics from Colorado State University in 2022. Presently, I am employed by the Statistical Science group (CCS-6) as a Graduate Research Assistant at LANL under the supervision of [Natalie Klein](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VlHLqU0AAAAJ&hl=en).

My research interests include probabilistic machine learning, uncertainty quantification methods, generative and natural language models.
