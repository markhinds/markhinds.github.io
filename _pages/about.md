I enrolled at Georgia Institute of Technology to pursue a Masters in Computer Science with a specialization in Machine Learning in August 2023. Before enrolling, I was a post baccalaureate Intern at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) in the Information Systems and Modeling Group (A-1) During the summer of 2022, and the majority of 2023. I had worked under Nathanial Blanchard in the HCAI research group at Colorado State University (2021â€“2022). I completed my B.S in Statistics at Colorado State University in 2022. I'm currently work for the Statistical Science group (CCS-6) at LANL under Natalie Klein.

* May 2022-August 2023: Post-Baccalaureate Intern (Los Alamos National Lab)
A-1: National Critical Decomposition
- Created decompositions for national critical functions using internal software by researching key subfunctions to systems.
- Researched risk and sensitivity quantification methods to understand propagation in interdependent systems.
A-1: Electrical Power Restoration Modeling (A-1: Information Systems and Modeling)
- Developed python scripts to collect geospatial earthquake data.
- Created visualizations, plots and tables summarizing key statistics in R.
- Conducted a literature review for current state of the art power restoration models during extreme storm events.
- Supporting the development of a national scale model to predict the outage assessment and repair times following an extreme storm event.
A-1: Outage Prediction Modeling (A-1: Information Systems and Modeling)
- Developed a data pipeline to build a dataset that improves the spatial and temporal resolution of the current in- production outage prediction model using Python and R.
- Identified key parameters used in published and in production models.
- Collaborated with a team of researchers to design an efficient outage prediction model.
- Analyzed the dataset to produce visualizations and insightful metrics based off exploratory data analysis.
